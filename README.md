## 📦 Dataset
- **churn_data.xlsx:** Contains customer data for analysis, including demographic information, purchase history, and churn status.

---

## 🔍 Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Removed null values and standardized data types.

2. **SQL Analysis:**
   - Extracted key metrics such as average purchase frequency, customer tenure, and churn rate.

3. **Power BI Dashboards:**
   - Created interactive visualizations to monitor churn trends and customer segmentation.

4. **Python Analysis:**
   - Implemented churn prediction using classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run SQL scripts:
   - Execute `churn_analysis.sql` to extract key metrics.

4. Run Python analysis:
   ```bash
   python churn_analysis.py
   ```

5. Open Power BI dashboard:
   - Open `Churn Analysis.pbix` to view the visualizations.
